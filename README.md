I built a LLM inference VRAM/GPU calculator. With this tool, you can quickly estimate the VRAM needed for inference and determine the number of GPUs requiredâ€”no more guesswork or constant spec-checking. link: [LLM Inference Hardware Calculator](https://app.linpp2009.com/en/llm-gpu-memory-calculator)
